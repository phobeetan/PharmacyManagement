Our database handles patients, pharmacist, and medicines and facilitates a ‘first in, first out’ prescription model
Patients will see when their medicine expires, what their dosage is, and when they can pick up their next prescription.
Pharmacists will see what medicines are in stock, which ones expire sooner, when patients will need refills, and when they should restock certain medicines.
Medicine bottles will be grouped by medicine. These groups will have methods to sort by which bottle is soonest to expire and when stock is running low.
This database will solve the problems of efficiency and proper pharmaceutical tracking, in turn increasing patient care quality.
